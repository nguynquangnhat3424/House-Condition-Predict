# House Condition Predict

This project aims to predict the house condition ('NOR', 'ABN', 'PAR', 'ADL', 'ALC', 'FAM') using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset contains various features that influence the house condition, such as:
* LotFrontage

* YearBuilt

* BsmtQual

* BsmtExposure

* BedroomAbvGr


**Steps:**

* Import data: The data will be imported from a CSV file using Python.

* Preprocessing: The data will be cleaned and preprocessed by removing missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

* Split data: The data will be split into training and testing sets.

* Train model: The KNN model will be trained on the training set.

* Evaluate model: The accuracy of the model will be evaluated on the testing set.

* Make predictions: The model will be used to predict the house condition for new data.

**KNN Algorithm**

The KNN algorithm is a simple and effective machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the k most similar data points to a new data point and then using the labels of those k data points to predict the label of the new data point.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how to use the KNN algorithm to predict the house condition. The KNN algorithm is a simple and effective algorithm that can be used for a variety of classification tasks.

**Additional Information**

* The KNN algorithm is a non-parametric algorithm, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data.
* The KNN algorithm is a lazy learning algorithm, which means that it does not build a model of the data during the training phase.
* The KNN algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which means that it requires labeled data for training.

**Before you continue, ensure you meet the following requirements:**

* You have installed the latest version of Python.
